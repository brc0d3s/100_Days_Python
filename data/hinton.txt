Prof. Geoffrey Hinton has raised ethical issues related to the use AI and machine learning.After he pioneered techniques such as back propagation, algorithms like the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and having worked in projects like Google Brains, Geoffrey is now switching his efforts towards creating awareness on the dangers of the same thing he helped create. He admits that after mechanizing thinking in expert systems, we have now automated it in machine learning and in its variants like deep learning. We have created a tool that can solve many problems for humans but at the same time, a tool we might not control and therein lies a big risk. GPT4 has helped draw attention to this reality.
